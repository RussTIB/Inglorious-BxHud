To get the voicemenu animations or (Ammo -> speed-o-meter)
just place this entire command/bind to your autoexec or 
class cfg [To keep note it works with anything and voicemenu animations might be weird]

bind 1 +b
alias +b "s1;voice_menu_1;"
alias -b "voice_menu_1;"
alias s1 "slot1"
bind 3 a
alias a "s3;voice_menu_1;"
alias s3 "slot3;voice_menu_1""
